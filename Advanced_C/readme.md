Welcome to my repository for the Advanced C programming course, taught by Jason Fedin.
This is a continuation from the beginner C course I did, which u can find in my courses repo.

You can find the course at this link: https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-c-programming-course/

In this course, we built upon the foundations from the beginner C course and learned advanced C programming concepts.
Such as making our own data types, or data structures and sockets where we can connect to the internet and make our own server.
