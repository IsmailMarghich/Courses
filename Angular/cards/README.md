# Cards

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.9.

A simple app that shows cards with images, titles, usernames and content. This was made to learn about Angular components.
We used *Ngfor to easily generate these card components based on an object, we also used interpolation and property binding
to add our data to our components.
