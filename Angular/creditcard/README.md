# Creditcard

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.9.

An app where a user can enter (fake) credit card information to be displayed on a credit card on the screen.
This was made to learn about Angular Reactive forms, we used Angular's built-in validation to make sure our user enters the correct data.
