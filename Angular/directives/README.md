# Directives

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.9.

A simple image browser with pagination to control what image the users see.
The purpose of this project was to showcase attribute and strucutal directives such as *ngfor and *ngif to add logic to the site within the HTML.
We also created our own attribute directive that served as a replacement to the ngclass directive provided by Angular.
