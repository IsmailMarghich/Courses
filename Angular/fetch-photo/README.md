# FetchPhoto

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.9.

A simple app which will randomly fetch an image from unsplash and display it, this was made to showcase the httpclient model in Angular,
and how we use observables and subscribe along with typescript interfaces to add proper error checking to our responses.
