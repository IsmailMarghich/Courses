# MathGame

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.9.

A simple game where a user has to quickly solve simple math problems. 
In this project we made use of our own custom validators, to validate our form. We also made use of RxJs to check whether the user has a correct or close answer.
This was made using Reactive Forms from Angular.
