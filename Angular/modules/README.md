# Modules

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.9.

In this project we made a website where we showcase components from Semantic UI that I have made reusable.
The site contains multiple pages with multiple components such as a Modal and a Placeholder.
We used modules to organize our components, and added lazy routing to improve the peformance of the website,
we also used advanced routing to create a dynamic tab menu seen on the Collection page.
