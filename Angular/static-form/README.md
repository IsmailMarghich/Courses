# StaticForm

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.9.

A simple email form made with Angular's template form, this was made to compare it with Reactive forms from Angular.
Template forms are easier to set up for simple forms, but if you want to make a complex form that can change easily,
Reactive forms are a better option.
