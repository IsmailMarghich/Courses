# TypingGame

In this little project we learned about different ways of getting user input, comparing and displaying it on the screen.
We made use of both class methods and *Ng methods to make this typing game where your entered text is constantly compared to randomly generated text,
along with visual feedback and a pop-up when the user wins.
