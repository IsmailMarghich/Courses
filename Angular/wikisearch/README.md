# Wikisearch

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.9.

A simple app which uses the wikimedia API to searches wikipedia pages for the user and provides them snippets.
This is our first app using an API and https, and we also learned angular automatically escapes html characters on your website,
this prevents malicious users from doing XSS attacks, for styling we used Bulma css.
