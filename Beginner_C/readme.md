Welcome to my repository for the beginner C programming course, taught by Jason Fedin.
You can find the course at this link: https://www.udemy.com/course/c-programming-for-beginners-/

This course taught me the basics of C and allowed me to make a few programs like a guessing game and a tictactoe game.
