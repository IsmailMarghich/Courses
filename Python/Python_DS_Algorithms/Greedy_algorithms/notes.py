#greedy algorithms build the solution piece by peace
#in each step it chooses the piece that offers most obvious and immediate benefit
#fits perfectly for those solutions in which local optimal solutions lead to global solution 

#some greedy algorithms:
#-insert sort
#-selection sort
#-topological sort
#-Prim's algorithm
#-Kruskal's algorithm
#-Dijkstra's algorithm

#Problems:
#Activity selection problem
#Coin change problem
#Fraction knapsack problem
