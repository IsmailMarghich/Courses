In this folder I have posted my notes and code from the udemy Course: 'The Complete Data Structures and Algorithms Course in Python' by Elshad Karimov.
In this course I learned about datastructures and algorithms, and how we can solve problems with these in Python. The python files that start with a number are exercises from the course,
the rest of the files are notes and the basic code for datastructures and algorithms.

The course can be found at this link: https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-bootcamp-in-python/
