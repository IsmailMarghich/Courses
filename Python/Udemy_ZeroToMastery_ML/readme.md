Welcome to the repo for the course 'Complete Machine Learning & Data Science Bootcamp 2021', in this repository I post the jupyter notebooks I wrote, and also the data I used in the course.

You can find the course at this link: https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery/

There is 3 projects in this course, the first 2 are machine learning projects called heartdisease classification and bulldozer, the latter along with the dog breed identification project can be found in seperate folders. My notes and other things I wrote during the course are found in the main folder.
